# Python wrapper for the Spoonacular API ü•Ñüçé
This Python wrapper makes it easy to download data from [Spoonacular's](https://spoonacular.com/) marvelous food API.

I will be adding support for additional endpoints as I have time.

## Usage
```python
import spoonacular as sp
api = sp.API("your_api_key_here")

# Parse an ingredient
response = api.parse_ingredients("3.5 cups King Arthur flour")
data = response.json()[0]
print(data['name'])

# Detect text for mentions of food 
response = api.detect_food_in_text("I really want a cheeseburger.")
data = response.json()[0]
print(data)
```
